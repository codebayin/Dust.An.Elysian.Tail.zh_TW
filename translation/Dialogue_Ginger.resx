    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>WHOA! What was that!?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="007_030" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It came from the center of the village!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="006_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Mayor Bram mentioned you were leaving town.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="006_020" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Why would the rivers all be drying up? It's not like it's been very hot. And wasn't there a big rain storm a little while ago?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="006_010" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yes, the rivers and streams around Aurora are beginning to dry up completely. Without water, the only thing to do is head north. It's only a matter of time before the others follow me.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="006_030" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I know, it doesn't make any sense. To be honest, I think this whole country is cursed. General Gaius' bloodlust had scorched this land forever. I doubt we'll ever recover.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="005_040" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If only one man could stand against an army. Sadly no, there is nothing any of us can do. Any hope for the Moonbloods died with my family.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="005_020" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I've tried to help where I can, but it's hard. There aren't many Moonbloods left outside of their homeland, and it's only a matter of time before Gaius wipes them out entirely.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="005_030" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Is there anything I can do to help?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="005_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Why is Gaius so obsessed with killing these Moonbloods? What did they do?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="005_010" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Nothing. They... exist. General Gaius sees them as an impurity, a kind of cosmic mistake that he believes must be wiped from this world.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="004_140" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Fidget, please, calm down. She's right to be suspicious - I don't know who I am, but I'm dressed as one of Gaius' soldiers, and that can't be good.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="004_150" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Perhaps. But your friend is right. You've saved my village twice today. Gaius and his soldiers would never do that. Especially if they knew I was here.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="004_120" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>That is not an answer!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="004_130" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Hey, ease off! Dust can't remember, okay? He doesn't even know his real name! You know, you should be more thankful - he just saved this village twice, and I- well, I watched him do it, and I'm also really hungry!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="004_100" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And why is that? The last time I saw an outfit like yours was the day my family was murdered. That outfit, it belongs to Gaius' soldiers. Who are you, really?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="004_110" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I... don't know.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="004_080" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He was there the day my family was killed, yes. He was picking up supplies to bring back to his people. General Gaius attacked our village, burned it to the ground. I thought Fuse had been killed. Now I wish he had.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="004_060" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This war is turning all of us into monsters. Thank you, then... For releasing Fuse from his madness.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="004_090" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I'm sorry.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="004_040" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>What!? No! Never! Why did you kill him?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="004_070" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Right before the end, he seemed lucid. He told me a few things before he passed. He tried to tell me about the war, about your family-</value>
  </data>
  <data name="004_020" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Fuse? Oh no... He was leading those monsters? You killed him!?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="004_050" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He destroyed Denham Village, Ginger. Slaughtered dozens of innocent people. He refused to listen to reason and planned to attack Aurora next. I had to stop him.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="004_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Oh, you again. Mayor Bram said you'd left already.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="004_030" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So you know him, then? Was he always a homicidal pyromaniac?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="004_010" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yes, he asked us to stop the leader of these monsters. Turns out it was a Moonblood named Fuse. He'd gone completely insane.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="003_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You look sad. Is there anything we can do to help?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="003_010" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Please, you two, don't worry about me.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="002_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Are you okay?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="002_010" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Please don't take this the wrong way, but I'm not really in a talkative mood.</value>

  <data name="001_020" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Dust?  Really?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="001_030" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Is something wrong?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="001_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I didn't introduce myself before.  My name is Dust, and my companion here is Fidget.</value>

    <value>Hello again.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="001_060" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Well, that was a noble thing to do.  So thank you.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="001_040" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>No, I'm sorry.  It's just an interesting name.  I'm Ginger.  Oh, and about those people you saved...</value>
  </data>
  <data name="001_050" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yes?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="000_080" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I...</value>
  </data>
  <data name="000_090" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And there's nothing we can do about it. Excuse me.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="000_020" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Ah...</value>
  </data>
  <data name="000_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Hi there!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="000_030" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You're a quiet one.</value>
  </data>

    <value>Ah, yes. Well... good!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="000_010" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Well, hello.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="000_040" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Dust, manners! You'll have to excuse him, he's a bit worn out. Saving the village and everything, you know?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="000_070" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Honestly, it doesn't matter. They'll just keep coming back.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="000_050" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yes, I heard something about that.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="009_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Dust, that explosion came from below! Hurry!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="008_020" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Alright. You shouldn't stay here, Ginger - it's too dangerous. Head north, we'll catch up with you after we've gotten to the bottom of this.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="008_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>That's the last of them. Ginger, are you okay?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="008_030" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Stay safe, Dust. We'll meet again at Roan Pass, at the foot of the Blackmoor Mountains.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="008_010" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I'm... I'll be fine. You should go down below and find out what's happening.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="015_090" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Be careful.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="015_080" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Me, too, Ginger. I'll be back before you know it.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="015_070" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I know. Still, I'm glad we were able to talk, Dust.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="015_060" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Maybe... someday. For now, I need him to defeat Gaius. There's no other way.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="015_050" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Perhaps someday you can be rid of his foul presence.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="015_040" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I won't lie, I've felt him pulling me to take the quick and easy path, to leave the weak to fend for themselves, to show no mercy to those in my way.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="015_030" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As long as Cassius lives within you, though... there's always that danger. You could always be pulled to a path of evil.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="015_020" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I feel his presence every time I swing the Blade of Ahrah. I believe the Elder was right - without him, I'd have been cut down long ago, but Jin... Jin keeps him from taking control.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="015_010" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But what of your other half? Cassius murdered my family, Dust. He destroyed my village, killed my friends. How can you control such a terrible being?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="015_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>No, Ginger, I think you were right the first time. I think Jin continues to live through my actions. He's guiding me, keeping me on the right path.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="016_050" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I suppose I do. Well, I should probably get going.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="016_010" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>No, you're right. I need to accept that Jin made his own choice, and it's led to this. To you.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="016_060" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I understand. Good luck, Dust. Stay safe out there.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="016_030" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It sounds like you still have a lot of questions about who you are.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="016_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Ginger, you really need to let him go. I wish I could replace him, I do, but...</value>
  </data>
  <data name="016_020" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I just wish I could remember more. Sometimes I wonder if my thoughts are Jin's... or from Cassius... or if I truly am thinking for myself.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="014_030" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You do have his eyes. His face. It's so... strange. You could really be him.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="014_010" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I'm sorry, Dust, I didn't mean to suggest-.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="014_020" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>No, I'm sorry. I can't imagine the grief you went through in Zeplich... thinking I might have been your brother.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="014_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Like the Elder said, I may share your brother's soul, but the choices I make are mine alone.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="011_030" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He was very kind. Almost to a fault, really.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="011_020" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>What was he like?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="011_010" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yes?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="011_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Listen, about Jin...</value>
  </data>
  <data name="011_050" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yes, he had that effect on people. I like to believe it's what made you do all those wonderful things for Aurora and Mudpot.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="011_040" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I like him already.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="012_010" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yes... you, too.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="012_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I'm sorry, there's still so much to do. You take care.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="017_080" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Of course. Goodbye for now.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="017_050" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>No, you're right. We all choose our own paths. Jin chose his, and looking at you now, looking at the things you've done, I think he made the right choice.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="017_040" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I'm sorry things had to turn out this way.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="017_070" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I'm glad we had this talk, Dust. It makes me feel a lot better, knowing that my brother is helping to save this world. Come back soon?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="017_060" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I think he did, too, Ginger.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="017_010" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yes, Dust - your actions make you who you are.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="017_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I suppose I could be. I may not have his memories, but if his soul is guiding me to act as he would, maybe there isn't a difference.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="017_030" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I'd like to think so, Dust. It gives me hope that he didn't die in vain.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="017_020" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Then perhaps your brother lives on through mine.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="010_030" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I'll be fine. Just a lot to think about.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="010_010" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Jin? Oh... Dust. It's you.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="010_020" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yeah, just me. Are you alright?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="010_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Ginger?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="013_010" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And you listened to Jin.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="013_000" xml:space="preserve">
