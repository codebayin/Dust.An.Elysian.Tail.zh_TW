    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>If you want to ask Ginger about Fuse, I'd suggest you hurry. It looked like she was preparing to leave town for a while. Good luck!</value>
  </data>
	<data name="004_120" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They were helping the Moonbloods, of course. Helping the enemy is a treasonous offense. Ginger escaped, but her parents and her brother did not.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="004_130" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Regardless, I can't thank you enough for putting a stop to that mad beast before he came any closer to Aurora.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="004_100" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Not... personally. His is not a name we utter here without proper cause. I've never seen him or his soldiers personally, but tragedy tends to follow in their wake.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="004_110" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So why did they kill Ginger's family?</value>
  </data>
	<data name="004_080" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Her family was killed almost a year ago in Zeplich Village, a few days' journey to the north. General Gaius and his soldiers were looking for Moonblood sympathizers.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="004_060" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A lizard, you say? A Moonblood, perhaps. I wonder if Ginger would know anything about that.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="004_090" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>General Gaius? Do you know who he is?</value>
  </data>
	<data name="004_040" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Oh no... That could only be Denham Village. Did you find any survivors?</value>
  </data>
	<data name="004_070" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Ginger? That girl up on the hill?</value>
  </data>
	<data name="004_020" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Waiting?</value>
  </data>
	<data name="004_050" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I'm sorry, Mayor Bram, but there were none. This creature that attacked the village, he was some kind of lizard. Wore strange armor. Called himself Fuse.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="004_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Aha! It's great to see you back, son! I knew you could do it! The monsters have already calmed their advance. Tell me, what happened? Did you confront their leader?</value>
  </data>
	<data name="004_030" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In the middle of a small village, surrounded by the innocents he killed.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="004_010" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He was right where you said he'd be. In fact, he seemed to be waiting for us.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="003_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If he gives you trouble with fire, you know what they say!</value>
  </data>
	<data name="003_010" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Fight fire with fire?</value>
  </data>
	<data name="003_020" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You know, I tried that once. Nearly burned down my house. Come to think of it, fighting fire with fire is a terrible idea. You shouldn't ever do that. Ever.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="002_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Please, come back in one piece, Dust. You seem capable enough, but I could never live with myself if this somehow got you killed.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="002_010" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I wouldn't be able to live with that, either, Mayor Bram. I'll do my best.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="001_020" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This one does. There are stories that the creature is actually MADE of fire, but I imagine it's just an exaggeration.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="001_030" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I've got a feeling there's more truth to that than either of us would like.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="001_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We don't know much about their leader, but he has a penchant for fire.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="001_010" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I wasn't aware these creatures even knew how to make fire.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="001_040" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Regardless, there must be some reason those monsters follow him. Please, be careful.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_300" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The watchmen reported increased monster activity to the east of our village, so I imagine that's where you should go. But do be careful - strong as you may be, I've seen many fine warriors lose their lives to these monstrosities.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_310" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I understand, Mayor. I'll be careful. And I'll be back.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_280" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Alright, Mayor Bram, you've convinced us. We'll do what we can to help stop these attacks.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_290" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>That's my boy!</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_200" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It certainly would cripple their advance. You'd be doing the entire village a great service.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_220" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Well, I...</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_210" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>How about it, Dust?</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_240" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Helping this village is the right thing to do... but it's more than that. It's almost like... like I know these people. Like I have to help them.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_230" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You feel a conflict of emotions. This is good. I will abide by your decision, Master. I trust you to take the right path.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_260" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Charming as always, Fidget.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_250" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I think that strange feeling you've got is a little foreign concept called "compassion". I'm proud of you, Dust! Of course, if you'd said no, I'd need to bite your face off.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_270" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I think you've made a wise decision.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_180" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Well, whatever it is, it's become a serious problem. If you truly are as capable as I hear...</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_190" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You want us to find their leader?</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_120" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Then perhaps we can help each other. If you help our village, I promise I'll do whatever I can to help you, but I can be of no assistance while our village is constantly attacked by these creatures. We suspect their leader is close-by, and if you could-...</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_130" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Whoa whoa whoa, hold on a second! You're saying those mindless thugs have a leader?</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_100" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yet again with the modesty! You're no mere travelers, that much I've gathered. Mineral merchants don't wield blades as impressive as yours, Dust. Please - we really could use the help.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_110" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I don't know. I'm searching for something myself.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_160" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Our land, I imagine.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_170" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Just a casual observation, but they don't seem the farming type.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_140" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Until recently, they would attack us in small groups - nothing we couldn't handle. Now they coordinate attacks on a much larger scale, hitting the village on both sides, driving our forces apart. I assure you, whatever leads these things is experienced in warfare.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_150" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>What do they want?</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_080" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Don't concern yourself. We have other matters to discuss.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_090" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>What help could I possibly provide? A few giants in a field seem like the least of your problems.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_020" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>No need to be modest, my friend! We can't thank you enough for your help. Things have been rough in Aurora of late, so having a true hero in our midst is really boosting morale. So, what's your name, son?</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Good day! I'm Mayor Bram. So, you're the hero I've been hearing about!</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_030" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Dust. My name is... Dust. And some of the villagers I've met... they don't seem quite as pleased as you.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_060" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yes, that could only be Ginger. She can be a bit of a handful, but don't pass judgement on her like that. You have no idea what she's gone through this past year.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_010" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It's nothing, really. We're just passing through.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_040" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Ah, are you talking about the watchmen? You must understand, hardly a day goes by without some monstrosity attacking our peaceful village. They were simply being cautious. Take my word, I'm sure they meant no ill will.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_070" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>She looked pretty upset about something.</value>
  </data>
	<data name="000_050" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There was also this girl...</value>
  </data>
	<data name="010_000" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Thank you Dust, we are indebted to you for your help. Best of luck on your quest.</value>
